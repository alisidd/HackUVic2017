## Working with FruitList.json
All *produce* objects in the JSON array have the following attributes:
- name: Name of fruit (use to show on UI).
- price: Price of fruit (if isWeighted, per 100g).
- image: Image of fruit.
- isWeighted: If true, the produce object is weighed to get the price (price*weight). If false, the produce object's price can be determined by quantity (price*quantity).
- category (optional): If category is not stated, the produce item's category will default to the name.
